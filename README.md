# Intermittent Firebase Transaction Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Firebase transactions fail intermittently, even when the database is successfully updated.  The error message is inconsistent, making debugging difficult.

## Problem
The `incrementCounter` function uses a Firebase transaction to increment a user's counter.  However, the transaction sometimes fails unexpectedly, returning an error, despite the counter value being correctly updated in the database.

## Solution
The solution involves adding more robust error handling and retry logic. The updated code checks for specific error codes and retries the transaction a limited number of times before giving up.
